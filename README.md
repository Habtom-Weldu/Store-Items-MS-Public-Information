## Introduction

A professionally managed store has processes in place to receive incoming materials, store them until they are needed, and then issue them for use. The **Esi – Store Items Management System (ESIMS)** is designed to enhance the efficiency of these processes, shifting store management from manual to a more streamlined, computerized system.

The main goal of this software is to simplify the management of the ESI store by providing an intuitive interface for users. It addresses common challenges faced in manual store management systems:

- **Data Management**: All inventory data is recorded and retrieved from a centralized database.
- **Stock Monitoring**: The system keeps track of stock levels and automatically deducts items when used or expired.
- **Expiration Alerts**: The software provides alerts when items (such as chemicals) are nearing their expiration date, and notifies the user about expired items so they can be cleared from both the store and the database.

This software also includes features like data backup and restoration to ensure the security of your store's data. 

The **Esi – Store Items Management System** can be run as a standalone desktop application or in a network environment (client-server).
